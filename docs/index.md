## **Overview**

The cost and complexity of developing and integrating in-house network management may be too high for many NRENs,  
Institutions, projects or teams. Off-the-shelf solutions might not be suitable and might be costly. 

Network Management as a Service (NMaaS) aims to support these users in providing an effective, efficient network 
and service management platform. NMaaS enables management and monitoring of user networks through on-demand deployment 
of network management tools in a Kubernetes-based cloud infrastructure. Using a multi-tenant approach and software based
VPNs, each NREN or Institution has private access to their network management systems and services from a highly 
available cloud based platform.

NMaaS is meant for smaller and emerging NRENs, campuses, small organisations or distributed research projects that may 
have limited resources to develop and/or maintain their own NMS infrastructure or planned to outsource these activities.
By using a shared and supported platform, Institutions can focus solely on the monitoring and management of their 
service components. It is also suitable for use in those NRENs which provide campus network management service (CNaaS)
to their institutions. Using NMaaS, NRENs can easily provide per-campus network management software instances.

NMaaS (https://nmaas.eu) is offered within the GÉANT project as a production service since December 2018. Currently, 
the portfolio of tools offered by NMaaS consists of 28 applications including Oxidized, LibreNMS, Prometheus, Grafana, 
Zabbix, NetBox and others.
